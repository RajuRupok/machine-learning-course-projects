# Project 2 – Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch in Python to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 🧠 Key Components
- Custom ANN with forward and backward propagation
- Hyperparameter tuning (hidden layers, learning rate, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy and a confusion matrix

## 📁 Files Included
- `ANN_Breast_Cancer.ipynb`: Core notebook implementing the ANN
- `ANN_Breast_Cancer_Results.ipynb`: Results, visualizations, and evaluations
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset used
- `Report.pdf`: Final documentation of the project

## 📊 Dataset
Sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
