### Project 5 – MNIST Classification using CNN

This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits. The architecture was built and tuned from scratch to enhance accuracy on both training and test data.

#### 🔍 Key Highlights
- Developed a CNN model using Keras
- Achieved over 98% accuracy on test data
- Compared different optimizers and layer configurations

#### 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib

#### ▶️ How to Run
```bash
jupyter notebook mnist_cnn_detailed_experiments.ipynb
