# machine-learning-course-projects
This repository contains academic work completed for the Machine Learning course during my MSc in Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick. It includes five programming projects using various machine learning algorithms in Python, along with a final survey-based report titled 'Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning'.

## 📂 Project 1 – Adaboost with ID3 (Letter Recognition Dataset)

### 📘 Overview
This project implements the Adaboost algorithm using ID3 (custom decision tree) as the base learner. The model is trained and evaluated on the **Letter Recognition Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### 🧠 Algorithms Used
- ID3 Decision Tree (custom implementation)
- Adaboost Ensemble Learning

### 📊 Dataset
- UCI Letter Recognition Dataset
- 16 integer features
- Target: Capital letters A–Z

### 📈 Results
- Improved accuracy with Adaboost compared to standalone ID3
- Performance analysis included in `AdaBoost_ID3_Letter_Recognition_Evaluated.ipynb`

### 📁 Files Included
- `AdaBoost_ID3_Letter_Recognition.ipynb` – Model training
- `AdaBoost_ID3_Letter_Recognition_Evaluated.ipynb` – Evaluation
- `letter-recognition.data`, `.names`, `.data.Z` – Dataset files

📂 **Project 2 – Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using ANN (Breast Cancer Dataset)**

🔍 **Overview**  
This project builds a custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch in Python to classify breast cancer cases using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

📌 **Key Features**  
- Manual ANN implementation (forward/backward pass)
- Evaluation with accuracy and a confusion matrix
- Dataset preprocessing and binary classification
