# Project 3 â€“ Car Evaluation Using Naive Bayes

This project uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to evaluate car acceptability using the UCI Car Evaluation dataset.

## Files Included
- `naive_bayes_car_evaluation.ipynb`: Main implementation
- `car.data`: Dataset file
- `car.names`: Dataset feature information
- `car.c45-names`: Additional format descriptor

## Description
The model is trained on labeled car evaluation data and classifies instances into categories like `unacc`, `acc`, `good`, and `vgood`. Evaluation is done using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
